oodles of noodles, man. oodles.

Hello, world! This hub is where you'll find all of my junk files. I imagine I'll probably create repositories for any tools I end up using down the line, or other exploits that I need to use in my work, but for the most part, it'll probably just be my junk code that I need to share between systems as I learn. Enjoy!

About Me:
- 26, male, tinkerer.
- Cyber Security Dude.
- Learning Python, JSON, C++, XML, reverse engineering, and pen-testing.
- Always LFG! And looking for projects. Currently building a basic text adventure to practice Python and XML integration, looking at experimenting with bot code I found for Twitter and Instagram. Other than that... blank slate.
